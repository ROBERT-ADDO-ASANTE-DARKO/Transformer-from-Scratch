 # Transformer Model for Natural Language Processing

This repository contains the implementation of a Transformer model for natural language processing tasks. The Transformer model is a state-of-the-art neural network architecture that has achieved remarkable results in various NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

* Python 3.6 or later
* PyTorch 1.0 or later
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Architecture

The Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes a sequence of input tokens and converts them into a sequence of hidden states. The decoder then takes the sequence of hidden states from the encoder and generates a sequence of output tokens.

### Encoder

The encoder is composed of multiple layers of self-attention blocks. Each self-attention block allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence and capture long-range dependencies.

### Decoder

The decoder is also composed of multiple layers of self-attention blocks, as well as cross-attention blocks. The cross-attention blocks allow the decoder to attend to the sequence of hidden states from the encoder and generate output tokens that are relevant to the input sequence.

## Training

To train the Transformer model, you can use the `train.py` script. This script takes the following arguments:

* `--data_path`: The path to the training data.
* `--output_path`: The path to the output model.
* `--batch_size`: The batch size.
* `--num_epochs`: The number of epochs to train the model for.
* `--learning_rate`: The learning rate.

For example, to train the Transformer model on the WMT English-German dataset, you can run the following command:

```
python train.py --data_path=wmt_en_de --output_path=transformer.pt --batch_size=32 --num_epochs=10 --learning_rate=0.0001
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the Transformer model, you can use the `evaluate.py` script. This script takes the following arguments:

* `--data_path`: The path to the evaluation data.
* `
