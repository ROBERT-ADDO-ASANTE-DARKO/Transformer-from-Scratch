 ## BilingualDataset: A Custom Dataset for Machine Translation

This repository contains the code for a custom dataset class called `BilingualDataset`, which is designed for machine translation tasks. The dataset class is implemented in Python using the PyTorch framework and provides a convenient way to load and preprocess bilingual text data.

### Prerequisites

To use the `BilingualDataset` class, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.0 or higher
- Transformers library

### Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use the following commands:

```
pip install torch
pip install transformers
```

### Code Overview

The `BilingualDataset` class is defined in the `bilingual_dataset.py` file. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including `torch`, `torch.nn`, and `Dataset` from `torch.utils.data`.

2. **Dataset Class Definition**: The `BilingualDataset` class is defined as a subclass of `Dataset`. This class will be used to load and preprocess the bilingual text data.

3. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method of the `BilingualDataset` class takes the following arguments:

   - `ds`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a bilingual text pair. Each dictionary should have two keys: `'translation'` and `'src_lang'`. The `'translation'` key should contain a dictionary with the translations in different languages, and the `'src_lang'` key should specify the source language of the text pair.
   - `tokenizer_src`: A tokenizer for the source language.
   - `tokenizer_tgt`: A tokenizer for the target language.
   - `src_lang`: The source language code.
   - `tgt_lang`: The target language code.
   - `seq_len`: The maximum sequence length for the input and output sequences.

4. **Dataset Length**: The `__len__` method returns the length of the dataset, which is the number of bilingual text pairs in the `ds` list.

5. **Data Preprocessing**: The `__getitem__` method is used to preprocess a single bilingual text pair and return it as a dictionary. Here's a detailed explanation of the preprocessing steps:

   - The method first extracts the source and target
